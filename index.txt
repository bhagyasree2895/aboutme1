Section 01 - Chanda Bhagya Sree

I am a newly joined student from Warangal, India here in Northwest Missouri State University admitted in spring-2019 batch to pursue my graduation in Applied Computer Science program. I have been enrolled in Object Oriented Programming, Advanced Database topics, Web Apps course for this semester.

I had done my under graduation in Computer Science & Engineering from GITAM University, Hyderabad. I have worked for Rockwell Collins as an Associate Software engineer for around 1.8 years.

After working there, I thought I have to still improve technical, logical, programming, analyzing skills and learn lot more new technologies for moving ahead in my career. So, I have selected this path to grow professionally. 

I wanted to see myself as programmer with the hands-on experience I gain here from the courses I learn, work practically here. Hope, these courses help me broaden my knowledge further in advancing my career.
